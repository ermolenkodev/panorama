It is the onboarding project to get familiar with Multik, KotlinDL and other libraries from KDS ecosystem.


# Planned features 

- Stitch simple panorama from bundled images
- Implement homography estimation using multik and get results compatible with OpenCV based implementation
- Implement deep learning based keypoint detection using KotlinDL and compare it with SIFT based detections
- (Optional) Test extensively and make it work on arbitrary image sets

# How to
Tests is a good starting point to review project and get familiar with API
